# API Muslim v2 - ðŸ¦–Docusaurus (Unofficial Documentation)

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## About

During my first time using API Muslim v2 and reading documentation, I find it somewhat hard to find the information I need, such as how to use the API in a real project.

Navigating between the section are also not a great experience, I assume it is just how Postman documentation behave. I also curious on creating technical documentation.

Therefore, I intend to recreate the documentation using other technology and challenge myself to write technical documentation.

## Contribution

Since this unofficial documentation still lacks real-life project examples and other sections, I welcome anyone who wants to open pull requests that helps with the missing examples and/or informations
